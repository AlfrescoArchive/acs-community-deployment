## Troubleshooting ACS deployment in Kubernetes

### JMX Dump

This tool allows you to download a ZIP file containing information useful for troubleshooting and supporting your system. Issue a GET request (Admin only) to 
```
https://<host>/alfresco/service/api/admin/jmxdump
```

### Changing log levels

* The log levels for the specific Java packages in _content-repository_ can be changed via _Admin console_. Use the following URL to access it:
```
https://<host>/alfresco/service/enterprise/admin/admin-log-settings
```
*Note* Changes are applied only to one _content-repository_ node where the Admin console is launched.

* The log levels can be changed by modifying _log4j.properties_ in the _content-repository_ image and doing a rolling update to the deployment. In this case the settings will be applied system wide. See [customization guidelines](customising-deployment.md#k8s-deployment-customization-guidelines).

*WARNING*
 
ACS deployment does not include any log aggregation tools. The logs generated by pods will be lost once the pods are terminated.

### Port-forwarding to a pod

This approach allows to connect to a specific application in the cluster.
See [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster) for details.

Any component of the deployment that is not exposed via ingress rules can be accessed in this way, for example Alfresco Search, DB or individual transformers.
